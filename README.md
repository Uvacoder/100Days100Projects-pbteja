# 100Days - 100Projects

## Purpose 
I got inspiration for this challenge from [Florin Pop's 100 Days - 100 Projects](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/).
The goal of this project is to improve my programming and web development skills by building projects.

## Rules for me
- Create a project per day
- Share my progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pbteja1998)
- A project could be: an app, a component, a website, a game, a library, etc
- The project has to be done by 11:59 PM IST

You can see the finished projects live at [here](https://projects.bhanuteja.dev)
